# My-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to build a portfolio that can be seen by employers to showcase my previous work. This is to help ensure a successful career path and a brighter future. I learned how to problem solve often during this project as I ran into many issues but was able to resolve them in a timely manner. I also learned how to use an image as a link, how to add an image to my header, how to use a gradient background color, and many more things along the way.

## Usage

To use this webpage, you can click on the navigation link in the header and navigate straight to the sections you desire to read about first. Then you can click on the images to be directed to a deployed application of the slected project. Down below is my contact info that can be used as a way to reach me.
